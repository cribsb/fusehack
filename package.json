  "description": "This example uses the network stream to keep all clients in sync with the server-side simulation. When a client connects to the server it requests that a new player entity is created for it by sending the network command \"playerEntity\". The server receives this command, sets up the new player entity and then sends the network command \"playerEntity\" back to the client with the ID of the entity it just created.",
